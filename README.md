# Non-Euclidean-Computational-Engine-Python-source-code-

This software acts as a computational engine for typically non-euclidean structures.

###Features: 
- Interprets typed input commands and functions by matching it to a recursive regex.

- Function Interpreter from string to python-computable function
  - [x] Interpreter that can read combinations of numpy functions and python operators
  for 3 variables (x,y,z)
  - [x] Interpreter for n-custom variables using python operations
  
- Iterated Function Systems:
  - [x] Plot 
  - [ ] Associated Markov Chain
  - [ ] Dimension computations
